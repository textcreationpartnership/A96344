            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſpoke a little in ſome of the leafes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, of the fulneſſe of cur Saxon Engliſh Tongue, of its goodneſſe and worth; I will ſhew here, (that I may not ſeem to talk only) how eaſily we may utter our thoughts and wills, the drift of our minds, without borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our neighbours, and without going about, nay, and often without waking the ſleepie grave, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing life again into words hundreds of yeers agone dead and forgotten. We need not delue for buried gold, nor look back for words frightfully old (as they may goe at the firſt ſight) ſuch as would be dreadfull in their riſing: Were we but ready in the ſpeeches of the ſundry Shires, Towns, Boroughs, and Thorps of our Land,
<pb facs="tcp:169781:3"/>of the Weſt and North, (from whoſe broad mouthes (as they are thought) we may gather enough, though what we gather thus is wronged in them every day more then other;) if all theſe were brought into one heap, and rightly laid together, we ſhould finde our ſelves rich within our ſelves, without taking up on truſt. The moſt learned of the wiſe men heretofore,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſtot. de gener. ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. l.</hi> 4.</note> tels us, that he that is not like thoſe who begot him, like one or other of his houſe before him, is to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at as a thing againſt the kind. There are thoſe froward ones now, who, as if the blood of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were more foule then the ſin of our birth, and its guilt, hate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then them; not their outſide onely, but their goodneſſe (which never any breaſts were fuller off) is loathed by them, as are loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, not onely their ſpeech, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and lives, but their lawes and beliefe; ſleighting all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves, as if nothing were
<pb facs="tcp:169781:3"/>well laid hitherto, but we were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the world from the bottome, upon another groundworke: like ſome ſonnes of another adders teeth, or of our mother earth, lately ſprung up, ſons of the warmer Sunne, and ſlime, riſen but yeſterday. As to the Laws of our Saxon Engliſh, that I may deale within my own reach onely, (For from thoſe as from ſprings of wholſome waters, the ſtreames of our later Laws ſpread;) Whoſo will read them ore with a ſtedfaſt eye, will not meet the work or hands of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, but all things as far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as Heaven and Hell are aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. When he ſhall looke on the ſtrength and height of the walls, the ſmoothneſſe of the walks, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the whole building, he muſt ſee God has been there, or men of heavenly off-ſpring, the ſonnes of God. A worſhipfull Biſhop amongſt our greateſt for all kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but no friend to the Halle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailes us in this- That of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:169781:4"/>in of the Saxons hither, of their firſt workmanſhip, of the ſetting up and frame of their Kingdoms, the wiſdom which upheld them, of their deeds of the field, and their home Laws, worthy to be everlaſtingly kept in mind, to outlive the day, ſo little is now in being to be found. It cannot be withſaid, that through the retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe of men (to ſay no worſe) in the great earthquake of King <hi>Henry the eighth,</hi> ſtones did not fall alone, many of our Engliſh Writers were overwhelmed in the breaches, hid in their duſt, and the miſts and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be the thicker after. This is true, and we cannot be enough ſorry for it; yet beſides the hoords of books now left, thoſe which have not ſeen the light, (and likely never ſhall) and which have, and are in every mans hands, can teach us, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, no ſmall deale of that which is bewailed as loſt forever. And if there were leſſe (which I hope ſhall not be) the skill of a cunning
<pb facs="tcp:169781:4"/>hand may be ſeen by the ſhorteſt ſtroke. But bleſſe me, I am got abroad in open ſight, and muſt make a ſtand; The Readers leave (this cannot be helped) muſt be asked to goe on. I am told this is looked for from men unknown and untruſted (how ever from ſuch as come out alone, ſuch as want their throngs of wits, making room before them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking heartily the meinies ſmiles, who muſt be taught how to like, and whom.) I aske my leave then: but come ont what can, I will not buy it too dearly; I will not ſell my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for it; I wiſh the good will of all men, and that this child of mine might have a faire welcome into the World; but I will not throw my ſelfe at any mans feet, nor licke up his ſpittle for the kindneſſe. He whoſe end is nothing elſe but the good of others, ſhould not feare himſelfe, he ought to ſtand upright above this lowneſſe, as indeed he is; yet am I not ſo idle to thinke my ſelfe ſome
<pb facs="tcp:169781:5"/>merry Knight of the Booke, and that my over loving Witch by her mighty ſpels has kept theſe fields for my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that this inthralled Queen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be freed but by my arme, and that I was born for the hit. If ſome great undertaker, ſuch as the World would freely and willingly follow, had fallen on here, (which every Engliſhman is bound to, how learned ſoever) I had not ſtirred, I had ſtood ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in the ſhade. Now all that I ſhall get by this light, will be the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of other mens tongues upon me, if I come off with a few ſhort blowes of dulneſſe, heavineſſe, or weakneſſe, I am well; the beſt of men, ſuch as the wildeſt Heathens would ſtick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Stars, are ſtung by ſome; what is the moſt unmanly unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, the hallowed aſhes of the dead are curſed and torne up, of the dead who living held the Heavens up with their ſhoulders, made the Sunne ſhine, and the clouds raine: ſo farre is this bitterneſſe from being ill
<pb facs="tcp:169781:5"/>thought of; backbiting is the token of a good man: he that would not be ill ſpoken of, muſt fly from men. He alone who hides himſelf, never ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down in the ſtreets, is wiſe. But we live not onely for our ſelves, ſomething we owe to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, more to our own blood, to our mother England. And as many other men eaſily outgoe me, ſo there may be thoſe who may make but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up, who may be left behind; in ſo many houſes of fleſh there may be underſoules to mine. It is not any overweening which has thruſt me thus farre: The undertaking fairly to heal the unbeliefe of ſome weak ones (for I am not ſo brainleſſe to think that thoſe who ſide, and hate for their own ſakes will be ſhaken with words, that ſuch a ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can be ore come) who without any ill within, any unſoundneſſe of their own are led blindfolded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom they (it may be) have truſted too unwiſely, who would drive
<pb facs="tcp:169781:6"/>on to the utmoſt that hatred) is not heady boldneſſe to be chidden by any. I would ſhew theſe forlorne ones, how ſadly they loſe themſelves, how good and even the old rode is, how dark and uneven their own by-paths; how in the firſt they may finde the holy footſteps of their forefathers, and the wary ſteadineſſe of their treading: in the laſt nothing but winding and giddineſſe, nothing but everlaſting wearyneſſe; where, as is ſaid of the old Ghoſts below, they ſhall wander for ever, more flitting then ſmoke, and ſparks of fire, which however hindred by the winds, ſtriking them down, climbe upward on wings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, and at laſt are ſwallowed up, and taken in to their own home. If theſe be as willing to heare others, as they are empty themſelves, he who ſayes leaſt may win them; and ſo be, that they will bow at all, they may meet with ſtronger leaders, of the higheſt worthineſſe, ſuch as it will be no ſhame to them were they more,
<pb facs="tcp:169781:6"/>and better then they are, to yeeld to, if yeelding it ſelfe be not a ſhame) (where we run heedleſly upon things forbidden, which we ſhould ſhun, where we ſcorn to own, and as it behoves us forſake our overſights) which now with too many it is. If nothing elſe will take here, this may; I bring a mind free from love or hatred, I am ſworn to no mans words, I am bound to no man; I may ſay it, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; there is not the leaſt tie upon me which might ſway me fowly from the truth, if I ſtood not ſo faſt as I ſhould doe. So then, as I am not worth the ſin (nor any man elſe) I am not bought, I have no wicked, no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcore to be wiped out; Nothing but deareſt truth has drawn me forth, and that without the trimming or gilding of any mans hand or wit, has its kindly lovelineſſe; like Heaven above, it ſhines bright from its own beames.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169781:8"/>but that communion which beaſts enjoy in their wildneſs. It is as great an abſurdity as any of theirs to talk of Law, unleſſe it be firſt made plain, That there is any dominion, or propriety which may make that Law of uſe. For if according to theſe Brethren (whoſe dreams are Oracles) there be none, then are we alwayes in the ſtate of war, (unles all men will be contented to gather crums under a King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden's</hi> table) and the ſtrongeſt arm carries all. For the Leveller a neer kinſman, either we know not yet (which is the moſt lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) his ful meaning, Or he is not got paſt the old <hi>Agrarian Gauel</hi>-kind, ſo often contended for, almoſt to the deſtruction of the then but budding <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Tribunes there. <hi>Where it was the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſeditions, that all diſtinction being taken away, no man might know himſelfe nor his.</hi> (So <hi>Livie</hi> in that ſpeech made for the Conſuls <hi>M.

               <note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> againſt <hi>Canuleius</hi> the Tribune and his Lawes.) However, our Leveller is too unreaſonable to fancy ſuch equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lands, and Honours, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of Nature, which made ſome, more wiſe and ingenuous, more reſolute and adventurous, others, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169781:9"/>dull, and ſtupid; ſome (as if of purpoſe) fit to command, others to obey. It is highly injuſt too, that the frugal painful man ſhould gain nothing by his honeſt induſtry, nor the riotous diſordered ſot, loſe by his deboſh diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenes.

As to the pretended fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical communion of theſe Arrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious ones, ſo much admired by Poets, <hi>lactantius</hi> will not allow it in the firſt ages.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169781:12"/>Prince and Prieſt of the Family, and every wrong was done to a brother, an unkle or a kinſeman. But when men began to ſpread into Families, Tribes, and Nations, not contented with the homelineſſe and ſimplicity of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor with things freely growing, and at hand, every man imployed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to get thoſe things which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived neceſſary, either for his ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or pleaſure, which no man would have done, if like <hi>

This made <hi>Noah</hi> plant his Vineyard, and others buſie themſelves to finde out all thoſe arts, which might either make the earth fruitfull, or delight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit themſelves; ſo that (as we finde it in all Hiſtories) there was a neceſſity for propriety then. And as with great reaſon, and I may ſay of divine right, propriety came in, without great wrong, and univerſall confuſion it cannot be taken away: the leaſt conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the leaſt ſlackning of this law of propriety muſt be fatall; a huge licence and deluge of injuries would follow, when our experience makes it manifeſt, that lawes in force, and all the Courts of Judicature cannot reftrein the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

We know all laws come not in by heaps but as time corrupts things, and new wrongs, and offences are diſcovered, by the ſame degrees. Thus the Sumptuary laws amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> came in, the <hi>Fabian</hi> of <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> the <hi>Julian</hi> of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or private force, <hi>de ambitu,</hi> and the reſt, all our Statute laws which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying. So muſt it be, and ſo it has been, in all Commonwealths, of all laws whatſoever, unleſſe there could be a ſtay of mens manners, unleſſe they could move in an orderly courſe, either continually running upon things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169781:64"/>or avoiding them, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to their own goodneſſe, or their lawleſſe ſins, there muſt be new Laws to amend what is amiſſe, unleſſe Propheſie may be preſuppoſed in the firſt Lawgiver who w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> caſt of his eye w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> one look can ſee every thing. Thus we have ſeen whatour laws are, &amp; from what fountain they flow; ſo then their diſcontent who onely hate the ſword, and by whom the laws are loathed in no other notion but that of <hi>Norman</hi> conqueſt muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: they being not onely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be juſtly made, and according to the law of Nations, weighed, and allowed, not by the wiſdome of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row age, but imbeliſhed, and poliſhed by the experience, and wiſdom of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers, (the fundamentals being yet of an higher riſe) and what is moſt of all Saxon-Engliſh, muſt needs be vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; they will be ſo, with thoſe who are won by reaſon, and with thoſe who are not capable of that, yet will be taken with the name, if their obſtinacy be not above their ſenſes. But if the law be not <hi>Norman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tenures.</note> if it ſuffer that which is (ſome will ſay it is the ſame) whether the Wen be native born with the face, or <hi>ad nate</hi> growing upon it after, the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

And the next guilt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the Iaw, is the vaſſallage of feudes, or Tenures, being a ſervitude thought unworthy of free men, it may eaſily be ſhown, that thoſe were not firſt ſhown us by the <hi>Normans,</hi> that they had made their entrance long before, and if this be culpable, ſcarce any laws, but none of thoſe of the <hi>Germane</hi> fountain (from which the moſt of theſe as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the weſtern world are derived) are innocent.

There is aprohibition in two Statutes, That no man of the Law ſhall be from henceforth Juſtice of Aſſiſes, or of the common deliverance of Gaoles in his own Countrey
<note n="i" place="margin">8 R. 2. c. 2. 13 H. 4. c. 2.</note>: and a third Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of confirmation is more full, it ſayes, That whereas it is enacted, that no man learned in the Lawes of this Realm ſhould &amp;c. be Juſtice of Aſſiſe in the Country where he dwelleth, ſince divers men learned in the Lawes, &amp;c. have by their means and policy, and for their own commodity &amp;c. obtained to

If things were truly looked into, we ſhould finde delayes, and other indirect courſes to proceed from the artifice, and unjuſt ſubtilties of ſuitors, of thoſe who proſecute bad cauſes to infeſt and wrong other men; and from the cheating
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169781:93"/>Mountebanks (a skum of litigious men of no rank nor quality, nor of any ſtudy in the Law) who undertake them, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors more doted on then thoſe of the profeſſion, famous for their integrity and induſtry, really and honeſtly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Impoſtors rather to be liſted under the notion of Incendiaries and common Baretors, then of any others, catching at any thing refuſed by the honeſt learned practiſer, venturing to ſoder the moſt broken title, by ſleights and falſe daubings, to the ruine at laſt of thoſe who imploy them, though not without ſome miſchiefe, and infinite vexation of the adverſary, and the injuſt Client having conſumed himſelfe much, is encouraged not to flinſhe, for what follows is blown up with freſh hopes, tampered with new ſhifts, and arts of reviving, till he has given himſelfe wholly up, till he is wilful, and at laſt like a Gamſter ſwearing over his laſt ſtake, he loves every tergiverſation, and ſtruggles with all his power and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to avoid the diſgrace, and loſſe of being overthrown; when he muſt ſee while there is any juſtice left it cannot be avoided: but when this blow hits him, though himſelfe was the worker,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169781:93"/>and the motion began and continued from his own hand, then he implores the faith of God, and man. Hence is a never dying quarrel to the Lawes, the juſtly deſerved calamity is imputed to nothing elſe. If deceits, and wrong may not be ſecure, and happy, the Lawes ſhal be curſed and blaſphemed, like <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Gods, rather carefull of any thing elſe then to provide (as he prophanely) for our ſafety. But in theſe exceptions to the Lawes the kindneſſe would be wonderfull, if the profeſſours ſhould goe free (as it might) we meet with an old cenſure which at the firſt fight ſeems ſomething,
<note place="margin">Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</note> which includes the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of all Laws alike, it is this, That the Lawyers of the beſt quality and fame, one and another, all of them, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome refuſe any man; and ſince their cannot be a right of both parties, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times defend the wrong, which in good conſcience they ought not, nor cannot wiſh ſhould prevaile.

And ſome ambiguities in clauſes and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may happen which cannot eaſily be tryed by any law before, nor can any Councellour very often aſſure himſelfe, he may give his opinion conjecturally, and probably, and that is all, accidents alone, the act of God may make things litigious, which it is not in the power of the moſt wiſe to prevent.

The obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not to be aſcribed to the fault of the Writers, but to the ignorance of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169781:101"/>thoſe who cannot reach them, long age weares out both words, and ancient manners, in which the ſenſe of the laws are comprized, he tels him the tables were compoſed three hundred yeeres after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> 700 yeeres, or little leſſe before their times, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires the Philoſopher, to give over the endeavour of defending and oppoſing what he liſted. To conſider more grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the things are he reprehends to leave a while the Acad my with its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. He tels him that the ſickneſſe, named in the laſt Law (for there he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) was no grievous ſickneſſe, ſuch as might make it inhumane to cite any man. <hi>Morbus ſonticus</hi> is the Law term to expreſſe that. That <hi>jumentum</hi> is not a beaſt but a carriage here, and that without this carrying to the place by law, the party ſummoned might make an everlaſting eſſoine. He ſayes, in the firſt law of injuries onely lighter inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were meant, beſides the <hi>AS,</hi> anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently was a pound weight: for greater injuries the <hi>Talio</hi> was uſed; which he grants could ſeldome and hardly be done according to the words and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law; but he ſayes in that, The <hi>decemviri</hi> intended chiefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169781:102"/>violence by fear. Nor did they think ſo much conſideration was to be had of him, who had maimed or broke any member of another, and would not agree with him to redeem the <hi>Talio,</hi> where he had his election, as to make it materiall whether the hurt was wilfully done or not, or whether there were that exact juſtice, and equality in the Talio, which is required by our Philoſopher. And how can it ſeem cruel (ſaies he) That that ſhould be done to thee which thou haſt done to another. For the other of the creditor cut in pieces, he givs theſe reaſons. The Romans (ſo he) eſteemed nothing ſo venerable, as the Publique and private faith, alſo in contracts as well as other duties, in the uſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of money lent. They thought this help of temporary want, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life of all men ſtands in need of ſome time, would not be had, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe of debtors might deceive without ſome grievous penalty, which went by theſe ſteps: after judgement the debtour had 30 daies allowed him to procure the money, if he paid it not, he was delivered by the Pretor to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor &amp;c. yet might he redeem himſelfe within 60 daies, after three of the great
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169781:102"/>markets he paid the ſcore with his life, &amp;c. The creditors (if more then one) being permitted to cut the body into pieces, a puniſhment denounced with the intent never to come to it, that no man ſhould ſuffer it. Neceſſary for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſake, becauſe wicked men contemn addiction and bonds; yet never as he (in his knowledge) put in execution. Can any man imagine (ſaith he) that we ſhould ſee ſo many as now we doe, lye, in giving their teſtimony, if the judgement in the twelve Tables were not antiquated; That the convict of this crime ſhould be thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock.

It is reported of <hi>Lodovico Pontano</hi> of <hi>Spalato,</hi> that he could not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169781:103"/>not onely the titles of the lawes, but alſo the whole body, yet he dyed in the thirtieth yeer of his age. Of <hi>Suae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> that he could cite any place of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in the very words of that father. Of <hi>Abulenſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Hic stupor eſt mundi qui ſcibile diſcutit omne.</q>
               <p>Of the Earles of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> of the <hi>Scaligers,</hi> we are told admirable things, of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that he could be asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he was not able preſently to give ſatisfaction in; beſides the tongues the Nubian too which he was moſt excellent in he had left (they ſay) no Science, no Diſcipline untouched. Of others that they knew as much of the Civil Law, as the great Civilians, yet could not be ehought to have lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſalute it a far off: who has not heard of the father of <hi>Venice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſuch there now be (as well there may, nature we ſee by theſe examples of the laſt times is no weaker then ſhe has been) of ſo firm memories, of ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py judgements, they are exceptions to my limitation, and are not to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if they be not too delicate to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169781:104"/>they may be ranked amongſt thoſe who do not invade. Such men have reputation to loſe, which they will not hazard ſlightly, they will conſider of things, and know well what it is they cenſure. Whenſoever they appear, they cannot appear but as friends, there can be no danger in them. Haſte, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance are onely to be feared, if haſte, (as <hi>Livie</hi> of it) be improvident, and blinde, what can ignorance be thought to ſee. Every man ere he gives his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Laws, ought to read them over from the beginning to the end, to look into them throughly according to that, <hi>In civile eſt niſi tota lege perſpecta, una ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua particula propoſita judicare, &amp;c</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Leg. in Civivile. ſt. de leg.</note>. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one particle propoſed, the whole is not to be judged. To the underſtanding of laws, the words alone are not enough the intent of the Legiſlator, the reaſon and end why they were given are to be enquired. By the words of the Law is meant their propriety and ſignification, which will not quickly nor without pains be known. The intent of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, is his preceptive will, ſeldome found by the words, abſtractedly, and nakedly, but by the adjuncts, the matter, or circumſtances. This is the intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169781:104"/>form. The reaſon of the law is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the end moving the Legiſlator to make it (not compoſing ſubſtantially the law conſtitutive) to which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and will of the Legiſlator is to be accommodated. This if not expreſſed in the law, but deviſed by the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is but a probable conjecture. Every diſadvantagious act of a drunken man by our law touching his lands or goods binds him. Nay, and touching his life too, if he kill a man he is hanged for it

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169781:107"/>may be: let us change till we ſhall not know our ſelves, if we retaine any face of Law, or Judicature, ſo it muſt be. I never heard (nor thoſe who have heard more) of ſuch a Law yet which could be learned, practiſed, and underſtood, without ſtudy, and which all men, but thoſe who had ſtudied, and underſtood it might be Judges of. The profeſſed enemies of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> as ſuch lawes, have not been many, no not in very many ages, much ſtirre there was, much diſquiet ere they were had, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtored.

                  <hi>Crete,</hi> ſo he ſaies, and if we believe him in that, we muſt believe him in nothing elſe. The Jeſuits were ever undermining, ever active, full of plots and treaſons, and their hatred cannot be imputed to any other cauſe but this, for the ills they had done, they feared the barre; yet this arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance they might take from the houſe of pride, of which they were. The Prince of which has ever (till we left him, where he had left the purity of the firſt ages) encroached upon our Lawes and government, praetending every where a certain aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit, for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he is to be obeyed, a courſe I would adviſe thoſe to take, who inveigh next, and have nothing to ſay to the purpoſe. <hi>The Pope</hi> (as the Venetians in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict tell the French Kings Ambaſſadour) <hi>attributes to himſelfe authority to define, and determine even againſt the opinion of all the world, what Lawes are juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, as</hi> Dr. Marta. <hi>Beſides the kiſse of the bleſsed feet, he has the free faculty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and abregating Laws</hi>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169781:109"/>Monarch over all the earth, that he might receive appeals from Princes, give Laws to them, and annul thoſe made by them. That Eccleſiaſticks are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether the Lawes of Princes be juſt, and whether the people be obliged to obey them; if we doubt this, think it with the moſt; if we tell the flatterers and Paraſites of this chaire, the former ages heard nothing, not a word of all this. They may reply in the words of <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. <hi>That the former Popes did not wel underſtand themſelves</hi> a great and certain mark of this preſent infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To keep on the old courſe of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the matter to the perſons, there is yet another quarrel of this kind, which I wil ſpeak to in a few words: There is one fling at the Officers, at the miniſters of the Law, and Courts. If there be any imperfection, any negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, omiſſion, or miſtakes in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of things (as it is but an huge folly to conceive men ſo full of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and vigilancy, but there may be) I ſee not why this ſhould be a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to the Law, unleſſe it may be thought to favour murder or theft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are done, Lawes can but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and puniſh offences, if the vices or faults of men muſt aſperſe ſciences, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169781:111"/>left out. The example of <hi>the action of injuries,</hi> and of <hi>the action upon the eaſe</hi> which are the ſame, are compared by M. <hi>Fulbeck,</hi>

I will onely compare (yet not at large) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this action of Injuries, of a leſſe bulke then the Libell, and the barre in the action of the Caſe, after a tedious recitall of that which makes little, of the malice, &amp;c. of the actor, after a long prayer to be abſolved, and that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer may bee condemned in charges, ſtretched neare to the length of twenty lines, where the Latin runs (as in all Lawes it muſt) rather in a legall then an eloquent ſtile. The defence ſpeaks thus, <hi>Inprimis igitur dicit, ponit, aſserit, et qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus opus crit, prout ſupra Justificare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendit, Quod ipſe praeventus ſeu denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ex nobilib.

How is this recitall of the parents and their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick virtues, &amp;c. pertinent, to make the party innocent, and the Libell malice. The ordinary plea in barre (compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the generall iſſue) at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, goes more roundly off, and has no more words in it, then are of uſe and ſubſtance, being thus, after ſaying, That the def. comes by his Atturny and defends the force and injury—<hi>Et di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit quod ipſe non dixit, non retulit, nec pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagavit de praedicto W. verba predicta &amp;c. modo et forma quibus idem H. ſuperius ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus eum queritur, et de hoc ponit ſe ſuper patriam, et praedict.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169781:118"/>and ere our deſcendents ſhall make up what we ſhall leave imperfect (if our change be not diſliked and changed by them) they that ſhall invent the laſt terms, perhaps without ſome key or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wil not be able to underſtand the firſt. The length and change of time will make the next as obſcure as theſe; if we look upon our own language, and not ſo far back as <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and others of the moſt ancient Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh writers, if Sir <hi>Geofry Chaucer,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lidgate</hi> be compared, who calls him maſter, and betwixt whom there are not many yeeres, it may be ſeen how quickly it altered, as ſince the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, we know it has ſufficiently changed again. It was the obſervation of the illuſtrious Viſcount, that books writ in modern Tongues could not be long lived: he expreſſes it in the term for bankrupts <hi>cito decocturos,</hi> they would quickly break (which was the reaſon why he cauſed that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent piece, his Augmentation of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to be tranſlated into Latine) &amp;c. So that I cannot yet finde why the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of our termes ſhould be a cauſe of change. It is ridiculous to think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. The Lawyer muſt ſpeak the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169781:118"/>words of the Law: nor can the proces, and forms of the bar be expreſſed in neat and fine language.

It is a childiſh impotency of the mind, out of vainglory to calumniate illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, farre enough either from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty or diſcretion.
